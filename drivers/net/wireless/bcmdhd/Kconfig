	  This is an backported driver for the Broadcom bcm43362 SDIO WLAN chip found on Kobo Mini/Glo/Aura HD E-Book readers.
	  
	  Device firmware is required alongside this driver. You can download the complete 
          distribution from https://github.com/kobolabs/Kobo-Reader/blob/master/hw/imx508/ntx/
	  (file bcm-dhd-falcon-5901132-03112011.tgz)

	      
config BCM_DHD_FW_SELECTION
	bool "enable automatic selection of FW image"
	depends on KOBO_BCM_DHD
	---help---
	  There are 3 different FW images delivered with  Kobos in directory /lib/firmware/wc121
	  This patch appends the string ".WC121A2" to the default FW image pathname prior to 
	  download, if a chip with id 0xA962 has been detected.  It helped (at least on 
	  my Kobo) to get a self-compiled driver to work. However the original driver
	  works with both delivered FW images.
	  
	  If unsure say [Y]
	   
    
config BCM_DHD_WIFI_DIRECT
	bool "enable support for Wifi-direct"
	depends on KOBO_BCM_DHD && CFG80211 && !BACKPORT_KERNEL_3_99
	---help---
	  Adds another compileable chunk of code from Broadcom to the module. Therefore it will get bigger.
	  Normal connectivity to APs should work also without it.
	  
	  If unsure say [N] 

    
config BCM_DHD_DEBUG
	bool "DHD debugging"
	depends on KOBO_BCM_DHD
	---help---
	  BCM_DHD debugging messages. Choosing Y will result in additional debug
	  messages being saved to your kernel logs, which may help debug any
	  problems.
	  
	  If unsure say [N]  

    
config BCM_DHD_DEVELOPING
	bool "implement the cfg80211 support"
	depends on KOBO_BCM_DHD && CFG80211 && BACKPORT_KERNEL_3_99
	---help---
	  There are errors in the code. Interface definition has been changed and this part of code would not compile.
	  Switch this on if you are a developer who would like to correct the cfg80211 implementation.
	  It adds the files wl_cfg80211.c and wl_cfgp2p.c to the module and tries to compile them.
	  This option is only avalable in linux-backport-driver environment.
	  
	  If unsure say [N]
